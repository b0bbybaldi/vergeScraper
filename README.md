# The Verge - Scrapper
A fullstack web app that scrapes posts from the verge, users can specify if they like tech, science or culture news to be shown! 

Handlebars were used for display and mongoDB to handle server database. 

### Running the App
If you would like to run this from your command line, then you would need to have node and mongoDB installed in your computer.

If you do so, then it is as simple as running any other node application, following the node init -y, npm install, node server.js pattern which is explained in my other repos. 

You can alsp run the app from your browser on the heroku version [here](https://hidden-shore-60826.herokuapp.com/)
